# Build it and it will work!

Before we begin, please understand that this process will NOT work with any of the "main stream" environments like WAMP or XAMP. They encapsulate the process to "help you", to shield you.

This process will not "protect" you from anything. It will guide you and teach you how things work so you are better armed to handle issues that may arise an update your environment as you need to.

For example: We have a method to be able to easily switch between several versions of PHP without rebooting the machine or complicated configurations. In fact, there is a section on how to configure PHPstorm to use any one of several versions of PHP on a project by project basis.  


## Four Easy Steps

There are 4 steps to this process:
1. Create a secondary partition (I will leave that as an exercise for the reader!) or install a secondary drive
2. Add the [Environmental Variables](./Fusion/env_vars.md) to make the magic work.
3. Download the [superstructure ZIP file](./Fusion/assets/superstructure.zip) to give you an "instant framework".
4. Download the [CMD Tools](./Fusion/assets/cmd_tools.zip) to give you an "instant toolset".

### Step One
The first step is all up to you. But when you're done, please give it (the dreaded) Volume Letter of 'L' (For Linux!). You can give it any letter you like, but the predefined environmental variables all assume 'L'. I also suggest you format it using FAT32, not NTSF. That way you can open this volume using any other OS. Otherwise, you have to install Windows to recover this volume.

### Step Two
There is a collection of [Environmental Variables](./Fusion/env_vars.md) than need to be defined.


### Step Three
Unzip the ['superstructure.zip'](./Fusion/assets/superstructure.zip) into it. What you get should look like this...

![L Drive root structure](./Fusion/assets/superstructure.png)

This will give you 18 directories and only 4 files. We'll get into those 4 files later.

## Step Four
This is a collection of over 200 command line tools I've collected over the years.

Due to various reasons over the years I have lost the references to these tools.

Down load this [ZIP file](./Fusion/assets/cmd_tools.zip) and unpack it onto your "L" drive.

## Step Five
Now you can install whichever [Linux App](./Fusion/start.md) you are interested in.
