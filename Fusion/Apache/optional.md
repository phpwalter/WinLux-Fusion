# Optional Apache Configurations

This is an ever-growing list of optional configurations for Apache. 

If you have a setup to add to this list, please, be my guest!

### Additional Configuration Procedures
- [Virtual Hosts](./mods/vhost.md)
- [MOD Rewrite](./mods/mod.rewrite.md)
- SSL - <i>planned</i>
- Userdir - <i>planned</i>

## My Pipe Dream

I would like to document each and every MOD that Apache has, its configuration and how it works.

If you've made a particular MOD run, and it's not here, please make a branch (name it the MOD your adding) and submit your addition.
