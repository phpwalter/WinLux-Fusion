# Efficiently Managing Multiple PHP Installations for Apache on Windows

This guide offers an in-depth approach to skillfully handle multiple PHP versions within an Apache server setup on Windows. By following these step-by-step instructions, you'll seamlessly switch between diverse PHP versions, empowering you to navigate various code bases effortlessly.

## Introduction

Handling distinct PHP code bases across different versions can pose challenges. However, implementing a structured method to manage multiple PHP installations can streamline your workflow. This comprehensive guide provides meticulous instructions to streamline this process on your Windows system, ensuring an adaptable and flexible development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the setup process, ensure you've downloaded and installed the necessary PHP versions on your system. Follow the standard installation guidelines as provided [here](./php.md#Installation).

## Step 1: Organize PHP Versions

- **Create Version-Specific Directories:** Start by meticulously organizing your PHP versions into dedicated directories, explicitly labeling each directory with its version number.
 - Establish folders such as `php-7.4.0`, `php-8.0.15`, `php-8.3.1`, etc., within the designated directory path (e.g., `L:\etc\php\`).

#### Step 2: Apache Configuration Setup

1. **Obtain Configuration Template:** Access the preconfigured Apache file template, available [here](../assets/php-x.conf).
2. **File Placement:** Position this template file within the Apache directory: `L:\etc\Apache24\conf\extra`.

#### Step 3: Customize Configuration Files

1. **Edit Configuration:** Open the acquired configuration file in a text editor of your choice.
2. **Modify File Content:** Navigate to line 14 and replace the placeholder value with the respective PHP version's directory name (e.g., `php-8.3.1`).
3. **Save and Rename:** Upon making modifications, save the file and rename it to accurately represent the corresponding PHP version (e.g., `php-8.3.1.conf`).
4. **Repeat for Each Version:** Methodically iterate through each PHP version, ensuring the creation of distinct configuration files for every version.

#### Step 4: Configuration Management

1. **Organize .conf Files:** Efficiently manage configuration files by relocating redundant `.conf` files to the `disabled` directory within `/etc/Apache24/conf/extra`. Maintain only one active `.conf` file at a time.

#### Step 5: Switching PHP Versions

1. **Environmental Variables Adjustment:** Access the Windows Environmental Variables panel and update the `PHP` variable to accurately reflect the desired PHP version's path (e.g., `L:\etc\php\php-8.3.1`).
2. **File Movement:** Transfer the current `php-xx.conf` file from `/etc/Apache24/conf/extra` to the "disabled" directory.
3. **Activate Desired Version:** Move the corresponding `.conf` file of the desired PHP version from `disabled` into `/etc/Apache24/conf/extra`.
4. **Restart Apache:** Essential for implementation, ensure Apache is restarted to enforce the applied changes effectively.

#### Step 6: Verification and Testing

1. **Browser Check:** Post-Apache restart, access `http://localhost` in your browser to verify functionality.
2. **Confirmation:** The displayed PHP version should accurately correspond to the configured version.
3. **Thorough Testing:** Conduct rigorous testing by interchanging PHP versions to validate consistent functionality across versions.

#### Troubleshooting and Additional Tips

1. **Troubleshooting:** Address encountered issues by meticulously reviewing PHP paths, configuration file names, and ensuring successful Apache restarts post-configuration adjustments.
2. **Tips for Success:** Prioritize codebase compatibility, maintain comprehensive documentation outlining configurations, and diligently back up configurations before making any alterations.

#### Conclusion

This comprehensive guide equips you with the expertise to proficiently manage multiple PHP installations within your Apache server on Windows. Mastering this process enables seamless navigation through various PHP environments, significantly enhancing your development workflow.
