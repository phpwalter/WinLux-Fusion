# Optional PHP Configurations

This is an ever-growing list of optional extensions [EXT] for PHP.

If you have a setup to add to this list, please, be my guest!

### Additional Configuration Procedures
- [Apache Integration](./ext/apache.md)
- xdebug - <i>coming soon</i>


## My Pipe Dream

I would like to document each and every MOD that PHP has, its configuration and how it works.

If you've made a particular EXT run, and it's not here, please make a branch (name it the MOD your adding) and submit your addition.

### PHP EXTs

- get_text
- apc
- curl
- gd
- smarty
